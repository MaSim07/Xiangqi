> Combining Algorithmic Powers With The Beauty of Machine Learning

CheapChess is a lightweight Engine for chinese Chess (Xiangqi), designed to run on normal consumer hardware. Its development is motivated by the inacccessibility of innovative concepts to the community and the unaffordable resources required to run systems implementing those innovative concepts.
On a superficial level, the idea of CheapChess is the amalgamation of traditional methods of AI with innovative concepts of machine learning to create an agent that allows the strengths of each method to compensate for the detrimental weak points of the other.
