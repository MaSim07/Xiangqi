# Xiangqi-AI
- Xiangqi is the chinese version of chess very popular amongst East Asian countries.
- This project's final version will be able to process a physical board and play the best move for you :)

## General Information
> **What problem does it intend to solve?**
- The initial goal of this project was to compensate for my own very poor skills in Xiangqi with a computer's ability to crunch millions of numbers in no time and help me beat my grandfather.
- During the process of creation though, I discovered competitions like the national competition of Artificial Intelligence, which also have been contributing to my drive of working on this project
> **What's the purpose of creating the Project?**
- Artificial Intelligence and especially Machine Learning is very often perceived as this intangibly complicated domain of Computer Science, which is partly true, but not true enough to intimidate people into not even trying to get a fundamental grasp of it.
- With undertaking this project, I want to show that consistently achieving minor goals, making slow but steady progress, can accumulate to exceeding and superceding human brain capacity.
- I want people to know that if a normal 14 y/o, just with the help of a computer and research, can understand and implement the basics of AI and ML, can venture into the unknown territory of buzzwords and algorithms, anyone with the same resources can.
